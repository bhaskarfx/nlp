review
I see I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say!
Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. ÃŽÂ¾This review reflects solely on the poor service. ÃŽÂ¾I have been to this location countless times over the years. ÃŽÂ¾They consistently fail on the service end of things. ÃŽÂ¾The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of "sighs" and "lip smacking" when you talk to them. ÃŽÂ¾So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. ÃŽÂ¾The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. ÃŽÂ¾Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. ÃŽÂ¾I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. ÃŽÂ¾I could not recommend this location any less. ÃŽÂ¾If you can wait, take a pass. ÃŽÂ¾There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.
One Star and I'm beng kind. I blame management. last day of free coffee so "we" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. "Which one is which?" I asked... and he smiled and said "One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?
This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.
Let's start here only reason I came into McDonald's waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and ÃŽÂ¾for my duaghters. I don't eat fast food ordered two happy meals slow service... While ordering my food ÃŽÂ¾a guy ask the cashier two use his cell in the middle of my order that was strike one then give me little boy toys knowing I have twin girls stabding right in front of him. Im glad I will never have to return here I live way in sandy springs.... I can see the difference between service and the staff The building it self is brand new change your staff this is Blackmac not McDonald's im black myself but telling the truth
Other businesses throughout Metro Atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the Jan. 2014 snow storm. This McDonald's on Camp Creek Parkway told ÃŽÂ¾a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant. ÃŽÂ¾All they cared about was the dollar. ÃŽÂ¾After they got that, they were done with them. ÃŽÂ¾Too bad they couldn't have made it down the street to Wendy's or Chic Fil A and other restaurants.
The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. ÃŽÂ¾I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.
Believe it or not, this used to be q really good McDonalds. The drive throuh is so slow, it is frustrating but the service is always friendly. Food is normally luke warm. My niece likes the toys from McDonalds, I wonder if I pull up to the window and say, let me just get the toy, woulf service be faster?
On your way to the airport or just cruising down Camp Creek Pkwy? ÃŽÂ¾Are you absolutely in Love with McDonald's Sweet Tea? Well then don't ever go through this drive thru. ÃŽÂ¾Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. ÃŽÂ¾Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. ÃŽÂ¾As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. ÃŽÂ¾She told a few of her associates that it was like "syrup" and "liquid diabetes". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! ÃŽÂ¾Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken
This is the worst McDonalds I have ever seen. ÃŽÂ¾The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.
I had the McCafe Mocha and must say that it was better than drinking sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink.Stick with the Starbucks mocha, folks. ÃŽÂ¾Trust me on this one.
GHETTO!! went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces. ÃŽÂ¾Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. ÃŽÂ¾Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's "hood" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. ÃŽÂ¾plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes
I usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast. A lot of times the forget to include the hash brown if I order a meal. If I order hot cakes they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside. The food is also very inconsistent.
What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment. Woodstock Macdonalds is not the place that Ray Crock invented. Save yourself the frustration and waste if money, don't go there!I've learned now.
I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.
